# NOTE: The container runs as root. A previous attempt to run as a non-root user
# (uid 10001) broke upgrades for existing SQLite deployments — mounted data
# volumes (e.g. Railway volumes, root-owned bind mounts) were not writable by the
# non-root user, causing "attempt to write a readonly database" on the first
# migration. Running as root sidesteps volume-ownership entirely. Non-root will be
# reintroduced as a documented breaking change in a future major release, with the
# entrypoint chowning the actual (operator-configurable) data directory before
# dropping privileges. See the L5 note in the security review.
