//! Built-in job types implemented in Rust rather than Lua.
//!
//! The `happyview.` prefix is **reserved**, and that reservation is an
//! authorization boundary rather than a naming convention: a native job runs
//! privileged Rust with no script mediating its input, so if a Lua script could
//! enqueue `happyview.delete-collection` it would bypass the
//! `records:delete-collection` permission check that the admin endpoint
//! performs. Only internal Rust callers may enqueue these.
